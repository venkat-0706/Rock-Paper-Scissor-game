## Rock, Paper, Scissors Project: A Retrospective

**Project Process and Implementation:**

1. **Problem Definition:** Clearly defined the game's rules and objectives.
2. **Algorithm Design:** Created a flowchart or pseudocode to outline the game's logic.
3. **Language Selection:** Chose Python for its simplicity and readability.
4. **Input/Output:** Implemented functions to get user input and display game results.
5. **Randomization:** Used Python's `random` module to generate computer choices.
6. **Game Logic:** Implemented conditional statements to determine the winner based on the rules.
7. **User Interface:** Created a basic interface for input and output.

**Outcomes:**

* **Functional Game:** Successfully implemented a playable Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
* **User Interaction:** Provided a user-friendly experience with clear prompts and feedback.
* **Randomized Outcomes:** Ensured fair gameplay with random computer choices.
* **Correct Decision-Making:** Accurately determined winners based on the game's rules.

**Learnings:**
